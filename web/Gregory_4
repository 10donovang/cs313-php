After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Describe something from your database that you think came together very nicely.

I liked the interaction between all of my tables. I feel like it is simple but complex enough to do what I want. 


2. Describe something from your database that you think could be improved or extended in the future.

I think I am going to keep all of the user information on one table but if I could figure it out, it would be nice to have a different table for each new user. 

3. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
How to set up heroku databases. Though I am very nervous if I got it right. I am not worried about my code, more accessing the database with heroku. 

4. Briefly describe two principles of good database design.
Dividing the information into different tables in order to reduce redundency. Also determining the purpose of the database before hand.

5. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:

E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements


6. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.

I created all of the databases needed for my project in the most effecent way possible. I also made each of the keys that I wanted not null. Though I do wish I had added the contraints to the table itself instead of waiting until after. I had to drop all of my tables and recreate them.
